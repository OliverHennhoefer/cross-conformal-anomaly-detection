# Cross-Conformal Anomaly Detection
Supplementary code for the paper ['Uncertainty Quantification in Anomaly Detection with (Cross-)Conformal *p*-Values'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16388.pdf)

## Uncertainty Quantification in Anomaly Detection
Provided code defines and experimental evaluation setup for comparing the classical *inductive conformal* (or *split-conformal*) approach for anomaly detection to *cross-conformal* methods as derived from *(cross-)conformal prediction*.

## Setup
- Run with `Python 3.12 (>=3.9)`
- Install `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
